# COMP345
COMP345: Advanced Program Design with C++ 

## Assignment 1: 

### Problem statement

This is a team assignment. It is divided into distinct parts. Each part is about the development of a part of the topic
presented as the team project. Even though it is about the development of a part of your team project, each
assignment is to be developed/presented/tested separately. The description of each part describes what are the
features that the part should implement, and what you should demonstrate. Note that the following descriptions
describe the baseline of the assignment, and are related to the project description. See the course web page for a
full description of the team project, as well as links to the details of the game rules to be implemented.

### Specific design requirements

1. All data members of user-defined class type must be of pointer type.
2. All file names and the content of the files must be according to what is given in the description below.
3. All different parts must be implemented in their own separate .cpp/.h file duo. All functionsâ€™ implementation
must be provided in the .cpp file (i.e. no inline functions are allowed).
4. All classes must implement a correct copy constructor, assignment operator, and stream insertion operator.
5. Memory leaks must be avoided.
6. Code must be documented using comments (user-defined classes, methods, free functions, operators).
7. If you use third-party libraries that are not available in the labs and require setup/installation, you may not
assume to have help using them and you are entirely responsible for their proper installation for grading
purposes.
